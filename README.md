# NoteSystem

In this note system, every note belongs to the category of note. note contains five types of pointers in addition to the notes:
in pointer means which category this note belongs to, 
up pointer means which note this note comes from, 
down means which note this note affects, 
similar pointer means which note this note is similar to, 
and opposite means which note this note is opposite to. With these five categories of pointers, we can realise the categorisation of notes, as well as build complex knowledge networks1
